# General Applicable Checklist for Manual Expert Review of Generated Policies

This checklist is designed for manual expert review of generated policies (e.g., Terraform HCL, Kubernetes YAML) to evaluate functional correctness and compliance intent. It is applicable across different policy types and compliance domains, focusing on completeness, correctness, scope, enforcement, and potential vulnerabilities. Adapt or extend it based on specific compliance rules, tools, or organizational requirements.

## Checklist

### 1. Compliance Intent Clarity and Coverage
- [ ] **Intent Definition**: The compliance rules and their intent are clearly defined and documented.
  - *Example*: "Prevent privileged containers in Kubernetes" or "Enforce encryption for all AWS S3 buckets."
  - *Check*: Rules are unambiguous and well-documented.
- [ ] **Coverage of Rules**: The generated policy addresses all specified compliance rules.
  - *Check*: No compliance rules are missing or unaddressed.
- [ ] **Alignment with Intent**: The policy’s content aligns with the intended outcomes of the compliance rules.
  - *Check*: The policy enforces the rules as intended, not just superficially.

### 2. Required Configurations
- [ ] **Presence of Required Fields**: All necessary fields, blocks, or settings required to enforce compliance are present.
  - *Terraform Example*: `server_side_encryption_configuration` block in `aws_s3_bucket`.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true` in pod spec.
- [ ] **Correct Values**: The values of required fields are set correctly to meet compliance requirements.
  - *Terraform Example*: `sse_algorithm = "AES256"` or `aws:kms`.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: `privileged: false`.
- [ ] **Consistency Across Resources**: Required configurations are consistently applied to all relevant resources or instances.
  - *Check*: No resources are exempt unless explicitly allowed by the compliance rules.

### 3. Scope and Applicability
- [ ] **Comprehensive Scope**: The policy applies to all intended resources, namespaces, or contexts as defined by the compliance rules.
  - *Terraform Example*: Applies to all `aws_s3_bucket` resources, not just specific ones.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: Applies to all pods across namespaces (or specific namespaces if intended).
- [ ] **No Unintended Exclusions**: There are no exclusions (e.g., via labels, namespaces, or filters) that bypass compliance.
  - *Check*: Labels or selectors don’t inadvertently exclude resources from enforcement.
- [ ] **Handling of Edge Cases**: The policy addresses edge cases (e.g., imported resources, init containers) as required by the compliance intent.
  - *Terraform Example*: Applies to existing or imported S3 buckets.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: Applies to init containers and sidecars.

### 4. Enforcement Mechanisms
- [ ] **Default Enforcement**: The policy enforces compliance by default when optional settings are omitted.
  - *Terraform Example*: Encryption is enabled by default if not explicitly disabled.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: `runAsNonRoot: true` is set unless overridden with justification.
- [ ] **Validation Rules**: Validation mechanisms (e.g., variable validation, custom policies) are present to enforce compliance.
  - *Terraform Example*: `validation` block ensures `sse_algorithm` is valid.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: PodSecurityPolicy or admission controller enforces `privileged: false`.
- [ ] **No Optional Disablement**: The policy does not allow optional settings that can disable compliance enforcement.
  - *Check*: No flags or parameters (e.g., `enabled = false`) can bypass compliance rules.

### 5. Correctness and Completeness
- [ ] **Syntax Validity**: The policy is syntactically valid and can be parsed by the target tool (e.g., Terraform, Kubernetes).
  - *Terraform Example*: No syntax errors in HCL.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: YAML is correctly formatted and adheres to API schema.
- [ ] **Logical Correctness**: The policy’s logic correctly implements the compliance rules.
  - *Terraform Example*: Encryption settings are applied to the correct resource type (e.g., `aws_s3_bucket`).
  - *Kubernetes Example*: `securityContext` settings prevent privileged execution.
- [ ] **Completeness**: All necessary configurations to fully enforce the compliance rules are included.
  - *Check*: No missing fields or blocks critical to compliance.

### 6. Potential Loopholes and Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **No Missing Configurations**: Absence of required settings does not result in non-compliant behavior.
  - *Terraform Example*: Missing `server_side_encryption_configuration` doesn’t allow unencrypted buckets.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: Missing `securityContext` doesn’t allow privileged containers by default.
- [ ] **No Overrides**: There are no overrides (e.g., in sub-resources or templates) that bypass compliance.
  - *Terraform Example*: No module parameters disable encryption.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: No `spec.template.spec` overrides allow privileged containers.
- [ ] **No Ambiguities**: The policy is unambiguous and does not allow misinterpretation that could lead to non-compliance.
  - *Check*: Conditions or rules are clearly defined and enforceable.

### 7. Maintainability and Readability (Optional)
- [ ] **Readable Structure**: The policy is structured in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.
  - *Check*: Logical grouping, meaningful variable names, and comments where necessary.
- [ ] **Consistency with Standards**: The policy follows organizational or industry coding standards (if applicable).
  - *Terraform Example*: Consistent use of modules or naming conventions.
  - *Kubernetes Example*: Adheres to Kubernetes best practices.
- [ ] **Documentation**: The policy includes comments or documentation explaining its purpose and compliance enforcement (if required).

### 8. Comparison with Reference Policy (If Provided)
- [ ] **Functional Equivalence**: The generated policy achieves the same functional outcomes as the reference policy, despite structural differences.
  - *Check*: Both policies enforce the same compliance rules in practice.
- [ ] **Differences Justified**: Structural differences from the reference policy are justified and do not compromise compliance.
  - *Check*: Differences improve readability, maintainability, or efficiency without affecting intent.

## Scoring and Evaluation

### Scoring Method
- Assign a score (1-5) or pass/fail status to each checklist item:
  - 1 = Non-compliant or major issue.
  - 5 = Fully compliant with no issues.
  - *Example*: "Presence of required fields: 5/5" or "No optional disablement: 3/5 (optional flag present but not used)".
- Critical items (e.g., Required Configurations, Enforcement Mechanisms) may be weighted higher or required to pass.

### Overall Assessment
- Calculate an overall score (e.g., average of all items) or determine pass/fail based on critical items.
- Document findings with specific examples of compliance or non-compliance.

### Documentation
- Record detailed findings for each item, including:
  - Observations (e.g., "Missing `runAsNonRoot` in init containers").
  - Scores (e.g., "3/5").
  - Recommendations (e.g., "Add `securityContext` to init containers").

## Example Application

### Terraform Example
- **Compliance Rule**: "All S3 buckets must have server-side encryption."
- **Generated Policy**:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
    bucket = "my-bucket"
    server_side_encryption_configuration {
      rule {
        apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
          sse_algorithm = "AES256"
        }
      }
    }
  }
